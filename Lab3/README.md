# Simple Pomodoro Crossplatform App
## Short description

This laboratory work was made using React Native.
React Native lets you build mobile apps using only JavaScript. It uses the same design as React, letting you compose a rich mobile UI from declarative components. With React Native, you don't build a mobile web app, an HTML5 app, or a hybrid app. You build a real mobile app that's indistinguishable from an app built using Objective-C or Java. React Native uses the same fundamental UI building blocks as regular iOS and Android apps. You just put those building blocks together using JavaScript and React.

## React Native features

- React − Framework for building web and mobile apps using JavaScript.
- Native − You can use native components controlled by JavaScript.
- Platforms − Supports IOS and Android platform.

## React Native Advantages

- JavaScript − You can use existing JavaScript knowledge to build native mobile apps.
- Code sharing − You can share most of your code on different platforms.
- Community − Community around React and React Native is large, and you will be able to find any answer you need.

## React Native Limitations

- Native Components − If you want to create native functionality which isn't created yet, you will need to write some platform specific code.
